## About Me
Myself Vamshi, I'm a Senior AEM Developer with extensive expertise in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), specializing in AEM Assets, Workflows, and Digital Asset Management (DAM). With a strong background in integrating AEM with cloud services and third-party platforms, I have a deep understanding of AEM as a Cloud Service, and have worked with Adobe Workfront, Fusion, and AWS technologies such as S3 and Lambda.

Currently, I am contributing to CVS Health, where I leverage my technical skills in building scalable, efficient systems that enhance digital asset management and optimize workflows. I have also played a key role in integrating AWS and AEM with a focus on GraphQL and REST API development. Prior to joining CVS Health, I worked with United Airlines, where I contributed to various large-scale projects.

With a rich blend of hands-on experience in AEM, cloud technologies, and API integration, I am committed to delivering high-quality digital solutions that streamline processes and drive innovation.
